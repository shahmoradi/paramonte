.. function:: kde2d(x, y, n=256, limits=None)

   Return the 2d density map from discrete observations via 
   2-dimensional diffusion Kernel density estimation.

   First the input data is binned. After binning, the function 
   determines the optimal bandwidth according to the diffusion-based 
   method. It then smooths the binned data over the grid using a 
   Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation corresponding to 
   that bandwidth.

       This module is based on the KDE-diffusion of

       **Parameters**

           x

               A lists of array of numbers that represent discrete 
               observations of a random variable with two coordinate 
               components. The observations are binned on a grid of 
               n*n points, where ``n`` must be a power of 2 or will 
               be coerced to the next one. If ``x`` and ``y`` are not 
               the same length, the algorithm will raise a ``ValueError``.

           y

               A lists of array of numbers that represent discrete 
               observations of a random variable with two coordinate 
               components. The observations are binned on a grid of 
               n*n points, where ``n`` must be a power of 2 or will 
               be coerced to the next one. If ``x`` and ``y`` are not 
               the same length, the algorithm will raise a ``ValueError``.

           n (optional)

               The number of grid points. It must be a power of 2. 
               Otherwise, it will be coerced to the next power of two.
               The default is 256.

           limits (optional)

               Data ``limits`` specified as a tuple of tuples denoting
               ``((xmin, xmax), (ymin, ymax))``. If any of the values 
               are ``None``, they will be inferred from the data. Each 
               tuple, or even both of them, may also be replaced by a 
               single value denoting the upper bound of a range 
               centered at zero. The default is ``None``.

       **Returns**

           A tuple whose elements are the following:

               density

                   The density map of the data.

               grid

                   The grid at which the density is computed.

               bandwidth

                   The optimal values (per axis) that the algorithm has 
                   determined. If the algorithm does not converge, it 
                   will raise a ``ValueError``.
