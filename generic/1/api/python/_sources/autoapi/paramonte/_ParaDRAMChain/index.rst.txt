   .. py:class:: _ParaDRAMChain

   This is the _ParaDRAMChain class for generating instances 
   of ParaDRAM sample/chain. The ParaDRAM class's ``readSample()`` or 
   ``readChain()`` or ``readMarkovChain()`` methods return an object or 
   a list of objects of class ``_ParaDRAMChain``.

       **Parameters**

           file
               full path to the file containing the sample/chain.

           delimiter
               the delimiter used in the sample/chain file, which 
               must be provided by the user.

           parseContents
               If set to ``True``, the contents of the file will be parsed and 
               stored in a component of the object named ``contents``.
               The default value is True.

           markovChainRequested
               boolean value indicating weather the full Markov Chain
               has to be generated from the potentially-weighted sample 
               in the input file. If True, each sampled state in the resulting 
               output dataframe is guaranteed to have a weight of 1.

       **Attributes**

           file
               full path to the file containing the sample/chain.

           delimiter
               the delimiter used in the sample/chain file, which 
               must be provided by the user.

           ndim
               number of dimensions of the domain of the objective 
               function from which the sample has been drawn.

           count
               number of points (states) in the sample/chain file. 
               This is essentially, the number of rows in the file 
               minus one (representing the header line).

           [df]
               if the input file contents is structured in a format that
               could be read as a dataframe, then the contents of the file
               will be stored in the form of a pandas-library DataFrame 
               in this property (hence called ``df``).

           [contents]
               if the input file contents is structured in the form of columns,
               then a property named ``contents`` is also added to the object.
               Each component of contents will named via the header of the file
               and will contain data from the corresponding column of the file.

       **Returns**

           outputChain
               an object of class ``_ParaDRAMChain``
